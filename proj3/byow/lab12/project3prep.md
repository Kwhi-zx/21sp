# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:
I assume the start point is at the bottom left;Each different hexagon will draw begin at this point;
-----

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:
Yes,I can.I think it is the same in proj3;
-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:
I think I may try recursion in proj3; I don't use it in lab12
-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer:
They are different kind of things; But they look similar
